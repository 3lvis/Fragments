# Tailor

Tailor is a modern way of declaring your UI. It uses a declarative paradigm where you say what you want to have instead of creating `subviews` in your `ViewController`.

Tailor is great for creating detail views, every `subview` is a `piece`, you can make very complex detail views by combining all kinds of `pieces`.

`Piece` types:

- Text
- Image
- Slideshow **[Coming Soon]**
